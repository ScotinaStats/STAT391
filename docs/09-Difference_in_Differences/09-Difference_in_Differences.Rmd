# World Happiness Report

First, download the 2015 World Happiness Report, via the `world_happiness.csv` dataset in the **Data** folder. 

> What is the relationship between a country's **life expectancy** and **happiness score**, and does this vary by region? Specifically, we'll look at **Latin America**. 

--

First, some **data cleaning**...

```{r}
world_happiness = world_happiness %>%
  mutate(latin_america = 
           case_when(
             region == "Latin America & Caribbean" ~ "Latin America", 
             region != "Latin America & Caribbean" ~ "Not Latin America"
           ), 
         latin_america = fct_rev(latin_america)) 
```

$$\large \widehat{Happiness} = \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(\text{Life Expectancy}) + \beta_{2}(\text{Latin America})$$

```{r}
model3 = lm(happiness_score ~ life_expectancy + latin_america,

**Holding Latin America (TRUE/FALSE) status constant**:

**Holding life expectancy constant**:

\ \ \ \ &+0.0288(\text{Life Expectancy}\times\text{Latin America})
\end{align*}

.display2[General Idea]

The .display1[0.0288] is the **additional** change that happens when you combine *life expectancy* and *Latin America* in one model. 

- There is a **life expectancy effect** (.display2[0.102]). 

- There is a **Latin America effect** (.display3[-1.52]). 

- There is *also* an additional **life expectancy effect in Latin America** (.display1[0.0288]). 

---

# Interactions

\begin{align*}
\large \widehat{Happiness} &= -2.02+0.102(\text{Life Expectancy}) -1.52(\text{Latin America})\\ 
\ \ \ \ &+0.0288(\text{Life Expectancy}\times\text{Latin America})
\end{align*}

We can break this up into **two equations**:

**1.** .display2[Latin America] (Latin America = **1**): 
\begin{align*}
\large &-2.02+0.202(\text{Life Expectancy})-1.52(1)+0.0288(\text{Life Expectancy}\times 1)\\
&\ \ \ \ = -3.54+0.2308(\text{Life Expectancy})
\end{align*}

<br></br>

**2.** .display3[Not Latin America] (Latin America = **0**):
\begin{align*}
\large &-2.02+0.202(\text{Life Expectancy})-1.52(0)+0.0288(\text{Life Expectancy}\times 0)\\
&\ \ \ \ = -2.02+0.202(\text{Life Expectancy})
\end{align*}

# Your turn!

Download the `fastfood_calories.csv` dataset from the **Data** folder. Filter for *only* **McDonalds** and **Burger King** data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fastfood_mc_bk = fastfood_calories %>%
  filter(restaurant %in% c("Mcdonalds", "Burger King"))
```

- This dataset comes from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-09-04) via *fastfoodnutrition.com*. 

.display3[In your breakout rooms...]

**1.** Fit a linear regression model predicting `calories` as a function of `cholesterol` and `restaurant`. Do **not** include an interaction term. Interpret the coefficients.

- This fits a so-called **parallel slopes model**. 

**2.** Fit the same regression model, but this time **include the interaction term**, `cholesterol*restaurant`. Interpret the coefficients, particularly the interaction term. 

**3.** Discuss which model you think is "best" in this context!

# Quasi-experiments

---

# What is a quasi-experiment?

> A research design that aims to establish a cause-and-effect relationship. 

> A quasi-experiment **does not** rely on *random assignment*!

> Treatment assignment is **"as if" random**, though (e.g., through nature, government intervention, eligibility cutoff, etc.). 

--

.display2[Advantages]

- Simpler to design than RCTs

- Improved generalizability, due to lack of laboratory setting (they are **natural experiments**)

- Groups are self-selected (maybe not intentionally, but still...)

--

.display3[Disadvantages]

- Potentially susceptible to **confounding**

- Groups might not be well-balanced

# John Snow's Cholera Hypothesis

Back in the 19th century, many thought cholera transmission was **airborne**. 

- There were *three* epidemics in London, but no one could figure out how cholera was spread!

--

.pull-left[
[**John Snow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow), an English physician (not the GoT character), also thought cholera spread was airborne, *at first*. 

- Through a bunch of *anecdotal evidence*, Snow eventually hypothesized that cholera was spread by **water**, through the contaminated Thames River. 

- But he could not be completely convinced until he designed an appropriate study to *prove* this!

# Snow's Quasi-experiment

Snow couldn't just **randomize** London residents to drink from the *Thames* or some other *uncontaminated water source*! But he remembered that several water companies served different areas of the city... 🧐🧐🧐

- **In 1949** one company (.display2[Lambeth]) had moved its intake pipes upstream higher in the Thames, *above the main sewage discharge point*. 

- One other company (.display3[Southwark and Vauxhall]) had not. 

- Snow collected some data and determined that the different households serviced by these companies were *similar* on observed characteristics.

# Problems

## Comparing before/after in NJ

- You're **only** looking at the **.display2[treatment group]**! ("Treatment" = *min wage 👆*)

- It's **impossible** to know if the change in # of jobs was due to the treatment, or if it just occurred *naturally*. 

--

## Comparing only treatment/control "after"

- You're **only** looking at **.display2[post-treatment values]**!

- It's **impossible** to know if change happened because of natural growth over *time*.

# Back to Interaction Models

It is **much easier** to find a *difference-in-differences* estimate with **regression**.

- The **difference-in-differences** estimate is just the .display2[interaction term]!

- Plus, we can control for *other* possible **confounders**. 

--

.display1[General Format]: For person *i* in treatment group *s* at time *t*, 

\begin{align*}
Y_{its}&=\alpha + \gamma(\text{Treatment}_{s}) + \lambda(\text{Time}_{t}) \\
       &\ \ \ \ +\boldsymbol\delta(\text{Treatment}\times\text{Time})_{st}+\epsilon_{its}
\end{align*}
where $\epsilon_{its}$ is a random error term. 

--

- $\alpha$ = Mean of control group, **pre-treatment/intervention**

- $\gamma$ = Change in outcome **across groups**, *holding time constant*

- $\lambda$ = Change in outcome **over time**, *holding intervention constant*

- $\delta$ = **Difference-in-differences** estimate!

# Practice

In your **breakout groups**, use the `nj_min.csv` data (and the `nj_min_codebook` file) to **replicate** the Card and Krueger (1994) results. 

- $\widehat{ATT}=2.76$ - The average causal effect of the minimum-wage hike on employment

Are there any other potential confounders you might wish to control for? How does controlling for them affect your ATT estimate?
