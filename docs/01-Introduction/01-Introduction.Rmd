# Simpson's Paradox

.display1[Background] 

- [In 1951](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1951.tb00088.x), E.H. Simpson published a *famous* article (cited over 2000 times) that described an analysis of 2x2 tables that led to *paradoxical* results. 

--

.display2[What appears to have happened]

- A trend appears in *several different groups*, but disappears (or reverses) when these groups are combined. 

--

.display3[What is *actually* happening]

- The paradox is the result of disregarding the *causal structure* of the research problem [(Hernan et al., 2011)](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/40/3/780/746837). 

> Once the causal goal is made explicit and causal considerations are incorporated into the analysis, the course of action becomes crystal clear.

# OK, so what is causation?

A variable *X* can be said to **cause** an outcome *Y* if<sup>1</sup>:

- **Association**: *X* and *Y* are *associated*

- **Time ordering**: *X* *precedes* *Y*

- **Nonspuriousness**: The association between *X* and *Y* is *not spurious*

# Grades

- **Problem sets [20%]**: Completed in RStudio via *R Markdown*

- **Seminar/Journal Club Presentation [20%]**: Starting in **Module 4**, students will develop, present, and lead a discussion on a journal article and/or book reading related to the appropriate module.

- **Final Project [30%]**: You will submit a *causal research proposal* on a topic of your choosing and give a short presentation.
    
- **Casual Causal Paper [20%]**: Two *thought papers* (~2 pages each) will be assigned during the semester asking you to take a stance on a prompt, and provide evidence for that stance based on material related to the course.

- **Virtual Class Participation [10%]**

---

# Course Format

(I'll try my best to be consistent and stick to this format!)

**Tuesdays**: Interactive lecture introducing new material

**Thursdays**: Seminar/Journal Club Presentation, R tutorials, breakout room activities in R, etc.

--

- For maximum benefit, complete the assigned reading in advance and come to class ready with questions, and try your best to stick with the assignment schedule posted on the syllabus.
