# OK, so what is causation?

A variable *X* can be said to **cause** an outcome *Y* if<sup>1</sup>:

- **Association**: *X* and *Y* are *associated*

- **Time ordering**: *X* *precedes* *Y*

- **Nonspuriousness**: The association between *X* and *Y* is *not spurious*

(Pearl et al., 2016): *X* is a cause of *Y* if *Y* **listens to** *X* and decides its value in response to what it hears.

# Grades

- **Bi-weekly problem sets [20%]**: Completed in RStudio via *R Markdown*

- **Seminar/Journal Club Presentation [20%]**: Starting in **Module 4**, students will develop, present, and lead a discussion on a journal article and/or book reading related to the appropriate module.

- **Final Project [30%]**: You will submit a *causal research proposal* on any topic of your choosing and give a short presentation.
    
- **Casual Causal Paper [20%]**: **Two options**, both of which are *self-scheduled*, and you can submit at any point during the semester. :
    1. Write a review of a published journal article or news article, critically assessing it from a causal analysis standpoint. 
    2. Write a tutorial blog post on (a) any causal inference method covered in class *that you did not cover in your seminar presentation*, or (b) any method *not* covered in class that you'd like to explore on your own. 

- **Virtual Class Participation [10%]**

---

# Course Format

(I'll try my best to be consistent and stick to this format!)

**Tuesdays**: Interactive lecture introducing new material

**Thursdays**: Seminar/Journal Club Presentation, R tutorials, breakout room activities in R, etc.

--

- For maximum benefit, complete the assigned reading in advance and come to class ready with questions, and try your best to stick with the assignment schedule posted on the syllabus.
    - But...
